# Jest Practise

This project includes a set of JavaScript functions along with corresponding tests for each function. The goal is to implement and test the following functions:

- `capitalize`: Capitalizes the first character of a given string.
- `reverseString`: Reverses a given string.
- `calculator`: A simple calculator object with basic operations (add, subtract, divide, multiply).
- `caesarCipher`: Implements a Caesar cipher, shifting characters in a string by a specified factor.
- `analyzeArray`: Analyzes an array of numbers and returns statistical information (average, min, max, length).
